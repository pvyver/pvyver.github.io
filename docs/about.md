I'm Philip Van de Vyver, I live near Antwerp, Belgium.

## Career
 I’m professionally active since ~2000 and covered a lot of jobs.
Starting as a System Administrator, I developed myself into a Microsoft enthusiast. 

A highlight in my career, was my job at Microsoft, where I worked as a Premier Field Engineer with a focus on System Center Operations Manager and Microsoft Azure. While working at Microsoft, I saw a lot of Enterprise customers all over Europe.

Due to family reasons, I decided to become a Freelance Consultant. This is what I currently do, my current customer is a Cloud Service Provider with a VERY strong focus on Microsoft Azure.

My current core is Cloud Solutions Architect, where help customers with their Cloud Journey, in any kind of stage.

## Hobbies
When sitting at a desk most of the time, I like doing some sports in my free time.

I like to be on the water doing, Windsurfing, Kitesurfing, Wing surfing, …

I also love cycling and running when the on-the-water conditions are not great.
