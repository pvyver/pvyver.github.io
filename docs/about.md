I'm Philip Van de Vyver, I live near Antwerp, Belgium.
As a `Microsoft` enthusiast I love their products and the vision they stand for. 

## Career
I’m professionally active since ~2000.

A highlight in my career, was my job at Microsoft, I worked as a Premier Field Engineer with a focus on `System Center Operations Manager` and `Microsoft Azure`. While working at Microsoft, I saw a lot of Enterprise customers all over Europe.

Travel became tough for me family wise and I decided to become a Freelance Consultant. This is what I currently do, my current customer is a Cloud Service Provider with a VERY strong focus on Microsoft Azure.

My current role is `Cloud Solutions Architect`, where I help customers with their cloud adoption journey, in any kind of stage.

## Hobbies
Because I'm sitting at a desk most of the time, I need some physical excersise.

I like to be on the water doing, Windsurfing, Kitesurfing, Wing surfing, …

I also love cycling and running when the on-the-water conditions are not great.
