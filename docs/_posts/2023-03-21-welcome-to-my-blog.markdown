Hi welcome to my blog.

After some LinkedIn post, I've decided to create a blog for myself.

I created the blog using `Jekyll`. 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a system to create blog-aware, [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) web pages. Jekyll integrates nicely with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). And Jekyll supports markdown.

Enjoy reading the posts!
