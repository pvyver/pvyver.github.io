[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a system to create blog-aware, [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) web pages. Jekyll integrates nicely with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Using Jekyll, you can quickly create blog posts using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) instead of HTML (in fact, you can still use HTML is you'd like). All you need is a text editor, a terminal (or a Git GUI software like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)) and a web browser.

If you are comfortable with some terminal work, checkout [Jekyll Quickstart](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/). If not, you may want to look at GitHub Pages [Automatic Generator](https://pages.github.com/) and these [no-command-line](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) instructions. 

[This post](http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/2014/06/29/getting-around-with-liquid-markdown-javascript-html/) might help with a more in-depth understanding of how Liquid tags, Markdown and HTML are mixed together.
